# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to revisit this project later once i have a better grasp of making landing pages responsive across a wide range of devices.
Also styling animations such as any of the forms used in this project is something i find interesting and challenging.

Heres a short gif for the 'circle animation' used. [animation gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/yQkFKTdGuwRjb3cxQT/giphy.gif)
